## Nightmare Mode

- Try to write (or just think of) a function with one argument, `n`. It should use `console.log` to print the numbers from n down to 0 without using a `for` loop. Is there any possible way this could work? (Hint: It is possible and you'll need a conditional. This is pretty tricky.)
